I am Computer Science graduate student at BITS Pilani. My area of interests include exploring programming models, languages, and compilers. I love hacking with LLVM and C++. Currently I am working on Interprocedural Register Allocation in LLVM as my GSoC 2016 project. I also have developed iOS application that runs with Drupal 8 backend. I enjoy jogging around beautiful campus of BITS, Pilani.
